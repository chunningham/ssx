# DAO Login Workflow

_DAO Login_ is a workflow that allows _EOAs_ (externally owned accounts) or _smart contract wallets_ to log into apps or services on behalf of a _multisig wallet_. A _multisig wallet_ is a wallet that requires more than one private key to sign and authorize a transaction.

When DAOs or organizations that use multisigs need to make off-chain actions on apps or services (such as draft a governance proposal, or manage organizational profile information), they have problems due to there being no standard way for a decisionmaker to do it. This even extends beyond DAOs to include users that own multisigs and need a way to prove asset ownership held by the multisig while using an individual account to sign in to apps and services.&#x20;

We have collaborated with the [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) team to power a workflow that enables:

* Multisig owners to specify individual accounts to log in on behalf of the multisig
* Apps and services to enable this workflow

{% hint style="info" %}
In order for your app to have DAO Logins enabled, make sure to follow the related section in our [configuration guide](../configuring-ssx/#enabling-dao-login).
{% endhint %}

In the Delegate Registry Manager app from the Gnosis Safe team, signers will be able to add a delegate that can log into apps and services on behalf of the multisig. This can be accomplished by inserting their address in the `Enter delegate Address or ENS Name` field and selecting `Add delegate`.&#x20;

Once confirmed, this will generate a transaction that the relevant multisig needs to get approved. After the signer threshold has been met and the transaction is completed, that delegate should now be in the `delegations table` as an approved delegate.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We are currently collaborating with the Safe team on enabling multiple delegates to be added, as well as potentially app-specific spaces (e.g. someone who can sign in to a treasury management dapp but not a governance dapp).
{% endhint %}

Once enabled on an application, users that are delegates for multsigs will now be prompted to choose whether they would like to log in as themselves, or on behalf of a multisig they're a delegate of.&#x20;
